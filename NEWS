FLa4a NEWS

CHANGES IN FLa4a 0.700.x:

	NEW FEATURES:
		
	BUG FIXES:
		sr geomean fixed, it was failing due to including par "b" in outcome while admb was not reporting.
		R~ssb was using the previous year to compute SSB, now it matches the SSB with the correct yearclass.

CHANGES IN FLa4a 0.600.x:

	NEW FEATURES:
		MCMC fits
		a4a tpl copy method
		coda coercing
		
	BUG FIXES:

CHANGES IN FLa4a 0.500.x:

	NEW FEATURES:
		plots for residuals, fitted and observed changed to a gray theme and visuals updated.
		plot for residuals uses latticeExtra if present to plot the names of the fleets in the left side strip.
		plot for residuals includes aggregated catch in weight. 
		fitSumm includes a flag on convergence, 0 for true and 1 for false, to be inline with optim, although 1 doesn't mean the iters were finished just that it didn't converge. Tests updated.
		a4aSCA method now has the option to center only part of the fleets using a numeric vector (subsetting by position). It tries to get around the scaling issues by giving opportunity to scale only parts of the data. Scaling indices sometimes (allways ?) makes the qs less scaled with fs. Tests updated.

	BUG FIXES:
		plot for fitted and observed includes legend to id fit and obs
        plot for fitted and indices no longer calls x11 if more than one index, users must use multiplot device
		
CHANGES IN FLa4a 0.300.x:

	NEW FEATURES:
		Models can have up to 500 characters instead of the default 60. The previous limitation was creating problems, for example, when fitting models for individual ages, which were longer than 60 characters. 
	BUG FIXES:
		

CHANGES IN FLa4a 0.200.x:

	NEW FEATURES:
		added a generalized cross validation score to the fitSumm information 
		message about predictions turned off by default
	BUG FIXES:
		plot(fit, indices) legend added 

CHANGES IN FLa4a 0.150.x:

	NEW FEATURES:
		predict methods revised, not possible to predict stkpars of submodels
		tests updated
	BUG FIXES:
		predict of age specific biomass index now returns quant="all" and not the age range 
		default qmodel with sca was failing when index had less then 4 ages, now it sets ~1 if one age, ~age if 2 or 3 ages, ~s(age, k=??) for more then 3 ages
		
CHANGES IN FLa4a 0.140.x:

	NEW FEATURES:
		variance covariance matrix now comes from ADMB cov binary instead of inverting the hessian
	BUG FIXES:
		a4aInternal was accepting zero variances, now fixed 

CHANGES IN FLa4a 0.130.0:

	NEW FEATURES:
		tests on simulate revised and extended
		tests on WCSAM revised
	BUG FIXES:
		mvrnorm bugfix for empirical = T and n < length(mu) fixed by an internal function "mvrEmpT" which is called by simulate. 

CHANGES IN FLa4a 0.120.0:

	NEW FEATURES:
		simulate includes the argument "empirical" to be passed to mvrnorm
		l2a checks t0 that generate negative ages
		tests on l2a and predict revised and extended
	BUG FIXES:
		bug on indexing surveytime fixed
		bug on name matching between parameters and indices names fixed


CHANGES IN FLa4a 0.110.0:

	NEW FEATURES:
		class a4aStkParams includes a "wt" slot to carry on stock weights
		method a4aSCA uses an age range for biomass indices that is set in the range slot of the index
		method a4aSCA tags the index FLQuant using attr with info about the range and if it is a biomass index
		method simulate takes into account the range of the biomass index	
	BUG FIXES:
