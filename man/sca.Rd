\arguments{
\item{stock}{an \code{FLStock} object containing catch and stock information}

\item{indices}{an \code{FLIndices} object containing survey indices}

\item{...}{additional argument list that might never be used}

\item{fmodel}{a formula object depicting the model for log fishing mortality at age}

\item{qmodel}{a list of formula objects depicting the models for log survey catchability at age}

\item{srmodel}{a formula object depicting the model for log recruitment}

\item{n1model}{a formula object depicting the model for the population in the first year of the time series}

\item{vmodel}{a list of formula objects depicting the model for the variance of fishing mortality and the indices}

\item{covar}{a list with covariates to be used by the submodels. The formula must have an element with the same name as the list element.}

\item{wkdir}{used to set a working directory for the admb optimiser; if wkdir is set, all admb files are saved to this folder, otherwise they are deleted.}

\item{verbose}{if true, admb fitting information is printed to the screen.}

\item{fit}{character with type of fit: 'MP' or 'assessment'; the former does not require the hessian to be computed, while the latter does.}

\item{center, }{logical defining if the data should be centered before fitting.}

\item{mcmc}{an \code{SCAMCMC} object with the arguments to run MCMC}
}
\value{
an \code{a4aFit} object if fit is "MP" or an \code{a4aFitSA} object if fit is "assessment"

\description{
Statistical catch-at-age method of the a4a stock assessment framework.
}
\details{
[REQUIRES REVISION] This method is the advanced method for stock assessment, it gives the user access to a set of arguments that the \code{sca} method doesn't. In particular, the default for the \code{fit} argument is 'assessment'. For detailed information about using the \code{sca} read the vignette 'The a4a Stock Assessment Modelling Framework' (\code{vignette('sca')}).
