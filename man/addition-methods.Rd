\S4method{+}{FLStock,a4aFit}(e1, e2)

\S4method{+}{FLIndices,a4aFit}(e1, e2)
}
\arguments{
\item{e1}{the original \code{FLStock} or \code{FLIndex} object}

\item{e2}{a \code{a4aFit} object from where the new \code{FLStock} or \code{FLIndex} slots will be extracted.}
}
\description{
Update \code{FLStock} and \code{FLIndex} objects with stock assessment results.
}
\details{
If both objects have the same number of iterations, the \code{FLStock} slots will be replaced by the \code{a4aFit} slots, in the case of 1 iter, or \code{a4aFitSA} slots, in the case of n iters. If one of the objects has 1 iter and the other n, the method will simulate using the fit results from the \code{a4aFitSA} object to update the slots of the \code{FLStock} object.
